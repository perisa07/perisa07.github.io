The US has an alarming amount of domestic households that children live in and often times, children do not know that they live in an abusive household
and start to believe that abusive behavior is “normal”. This results in those children becoming abusive themselves and creates a chain of never ending chain.
When they realize they are in an abusive environment, the stigma around domestic violence prevents them from speaking up. I made this website to raise 
awareness about Domestic Violence in youth and help children identify an abusive household along with steps to get out of one.
